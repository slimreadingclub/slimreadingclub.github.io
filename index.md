# SLIM Reading Club Schedule

Organizer:

Ziyi (Francis) Yin, ziyi.yin@gatech.edu    
Rafael Orozco, rorozco@gatech.edu    
Thomas J. Grady II, tgrady@gatech.edu    
Felix J. Herrmann, felix.herrmann@gatech.edu    

[SLIM Group](https://slim.gatech.edu/) organizes the reading club that often happens in Friday mornings virtually. Students come to the reading club and present a paper relevant to the SOTA research pratices in the field of machine learning, uncertainty quantification, variational inference, and inverse problems. These presentations are usually informal, and the participants are encouraged to take part in the discussion and share experiences with specific domain knowledge. This website is maintained by the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/slimreadingclub/slimreadingclub.github.io](https://github.com/slimreadingclub/slimreadingclub.github.io). If you have any question or suggestion of the reading club series, please open an issue to the repo. If you would like to join our reading club or present your favorite papers, please open a pull request.
